# crashz-THE NEW AGE CHAT FREEWARE 
All new way of chatting on LAN programmed in C++

The idea is based on a delocalised simple database, a text file, that can be accessed by the program during run. Every new user in the network has a personalised account with the company with his chat history associated with the name of his friend. The program displays the chat of users connecting these associated names and extracting chats using objects.
